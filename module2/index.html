            <h2>HTML Summary</h2>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the heart of every webpage. It defines the
                structure of the webpage and annotates the content to tell the browser what to
                display and provide extra meaning. Without HTML, text would always be "just text"
                - there would be no semantic difference between titles, normal text, subtitles etc.
                You also wouldn't be able to add images or links.
                Even though browsers by default add styles for certain HTML elements (e.g. &lt;h1&gt;
                elements are bold and bigger by default), you don't use HTML for styling
                purposes!
                Instead, HTML adds semantic meaning to your content - it provides annotations
                that describe your content. And in the case of certain elements (e.g. &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;) it
                also tells the browser what to display (e.g. show an image) and what to do (e.g.
                navigate to another page).
                Your website is not just viewed by you but it's also parsed by search engine crawlers
                or presented by assistive technologies like screen readers. That's why describing
                your content correctly matters a lot!
            </p>
            <h2>CSS Summary</h2>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows you to define style definitions
                for your HTML document. These definitions will be picked up by the browser and
                control how the content will be displayed (e.g. that some text is red, which font size
                it should have etc.).
                Where HTML defines the structure and meaning of your content (and of course also
                helps with displaying the content in the first place - e.g. with the &lt;img&gt; element),
                CSS is used to then present the content exactly how you want to present it. It adds
                no meaning or annotation - it's really just about how things look.
                If oyu want to change text colors, background colors, sizes, spacings, distances,
                borders, shadows, positions and all these things, you need CSS.
